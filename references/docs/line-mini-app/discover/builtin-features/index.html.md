**Tip**

- You can implement a [custom action button](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/discover/custom-features/#custom-action-button) and place it anywhere you want in the format of your choice.
- New features, such as the ability to move back and forth between multiple chat rooms without closing the LINE MINI App, are underway.
- You can't hide the action button on the LINE MINI App. Also, **Module mode** can't be set for LIFF apps added to a LINE MINI App channel.

**Note**

To share the current page, users need to tap the action button on a LINE version that officially supports LINE MINI App. In case of LINE versions lower than the [supported versions](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/discover/specifications/#supported-platforms-and-versions), the action button in the header will always lead to the LINE MINI App's top page, regardless of the individual page being shared.

<!-- note end -->

### Multi-tab view 

The multi-tab view displays your recently used services. The recently used services section includes LINE MINI Apps and LIFF apps opened by the user, displayed in order of most recent use, up to a maximum of 50 items. The user can use the usage history to reopen the LINE MINI Apps and LIFF apps.

For more information, see [Multi-tab view](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/overview/#multi-tab-view) in the LIFF documentation.

## Channel consent simplification 

For a LIFF app to get user information or send messages to users, users need to consent to the corresponding permissions on the channel consent screen when they access the LIFF app for the first time.

In LINE MINI Apps, with the "Channel consent simplification" feature, users only need to consent to the simplification once. After that, when users access another LINE MINI App for the first time, the channel consent screen is skipped, allowing them to start using the LINE MINI App immediately.

For more information, see [LINE MINI App authorization flow](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/develop/channel-consent-simplification/).
